# beAWARE Ontology
This repository contains the first iteration of the beAWARE ontology, which was presented in project deliverable D4.2.

## Ontology Scope
The beAWARE ontology represents information relevant to climate-related crises, and, more specifically, represents the following aspects:
* Climate-related natural disasters;
* Analysis of data from the multimodal sensors;
* Rescue team assignments.

### Representing Natural Disasters



2.3.1  	
The representation of climate-related natural disasters in beAWARE ontology v1 is illustrated in Figure 3.
 
Figure 3. Representation of climate-related natural disasters in the beAWARE ontology.
Class Natural Disaster Type represents the various types of disasters, e.g. floods, forest fires, storms or earthquakes etc. Disasters may lead to other disasters (via property leads to); for instance, a heat wave may lead to forest fires, or storms may lead to floods. Each type of disaster is characterized by certain climate parameters, represented via class Climate Parameter Type. The actual manifestation of a natural disaster is represented via class Natural Disaster, an instance of which has specific climate conditions (via class Climate Parameter) with specific values. Impacts and incidents are also associated to natural disasters, via the respective classes. Figure 4 displays a sample temperature measurement, which was recorded during the 2017 UK heatwave  (17-22 June).
